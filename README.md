## Php test Janis A Laurins
Created on Windows enviroment using WAMP

- To setup application import the .sql file in database
- To run application go to ../db_oop_php/
- Focus on PHP OOP, not on design
-Task description:
-The expected outcome is  2 separate pages for:
- product list
- product add

-Product list should list all existing product and details, like:
- SKU ​(unique for each product)
- Name
- Price
-Also each product type has special attribute, which we expect you would be able to display as well (one of based on type):
- Size (in MB) for ​DVD-disc
- Weight (in Kg) for ​Book
- Dimensions (HxWxL) for ​Furniture
-An advantage​ would be implementation of the optional feature:
- mass ​delete ​action,implemented as  checkboxes next to each product.
